On April 2nd, jsOAuth, the javascript OAuth library, will finally have it's
first stable release, bringing the library out of perpetual beta and into the
realms of the big boys.

jsOAuth works with Appcelerator Titanium, node.js, CommonJS, Samsung Smart
Tv's and many other platforms that use javascript.

One library and one API to use everywhere your app is designed to run.

With a stable API you'll now be able to build applications without worry that
API changes will break your code.

I'm committed to making a great library and getting to this stable release has
been a long time in the making. The project started early November 2009, with
renewed interest in late October 2010 and has had a couple of key
contributions from Steffen Schröder, Max Ogden and several from Łukasz
Korecki. All these people saw potential in jsOAuth's simplicity and have
helped shape javascript OAuth for the future.

What if you spot something is missing? Let me know and I'll get it in and
tested as quickly as I can.
